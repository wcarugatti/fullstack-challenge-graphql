## Getting Started

- Run the project with `docker-compose up`.
- Go to `http://localhost:5000/graphql` for the apollo explorer, it will show all the possible queries and mutations.
- Go to `http://localhost:3000/` to check the frontend.

## Future Improvements

- Unit and E2E tests, I didn't do it because of time, but I like to work using TDD.
